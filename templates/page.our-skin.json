Also referred to as blue light, HEV light is primarily from the sun, but is also emitted by your smartphone, tablet and computer screen. Blue light exposure causes skin pigmentation, which is sometimes more pronounced hyperpigmentation than even UVB irradiation. Research has shown how destructive HEV light is for your skin because, like pollution particles, it can induce oxidative stress. To defend against blue light and pollution, we develop formulations that strengthen the skin’s recovery response and provide a second source of defense (Hyperlink to Defense Barrier).<\/p>",

Any sort of trauma to the skin, such as a sunburn or a case of eczema, can negatively impact TEWL levels in the body. Elements such as metabolism and sweat gland function can also play a role. External factors like drying skin care products and low-humidity climates can raise TEWL levels, creating dryness and even dehydration. Dehydration is the result of the rate of water loss in the skin outpacing its ability to replace it, and unlike dryness, requires more stringent levels of treatment - both internally and topically.<\/p><p>When dehydrated, the skin can feel uncomfortably tight. Dehydration can also lead to premature aging through the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and dullness. The Lontreau approach ensures we use ingredients that hydrate by improving the skin barrier and drawing water deep into the skin. To combat high levels of TEWL and an imbalanced barrier, we use hydrating ingredients that seal the moisture in. Rather than using heavy oils, waxes and butters, our combination of lightweight nourishing moisturizers and hydrating molecules gives us a unique approach to skin health and hydration (Hyperlink to Endurance Hydration).<\/p>",
