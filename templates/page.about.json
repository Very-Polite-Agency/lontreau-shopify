Like most modern women trying to find balance in a demanding world, she doesn’t have time for a complicated skincare routine. She was inspired to develop a line of products that support the extreme conditions of an athlete’s lifestyle — from pollution to the elements. As the co-owner of the 8 West Clinic, she sees the concerns and needs of thousands of patients. Beyond creating a skincare brand that meets the unique needs of an athlete’s skin, she is also passionate about creating a community that is inspired by the support and strength of female athletes. As of 2022, she is in her 6th and final year on the Board of Directors for Cycling BC.<\/p>"
